# Daemonz example: configuration for running starling.
#
# daemonz starts the daemons according to the alphabetic order of their
# configuration file names. start_order can be used to override this order.
# Daemons will be stopped in the reverse order of their starting order.
#
# daemonz likes to ensure that multiple instances of a daemon don't run at the
# same time, as this can be fatal for daemons with on-disk state, like ferret.
# So daemonz ensures that a daemon is dead before starting it, and right after
# stopping it. This is achieved using the following means:
#   * Stop commands: first, daemonz uses the stop command supplied in the
#                    daemon configuration
#   * PID files: if the daemon has .pid files, daemonz tries to read the file
#                and find the corresponding processes, then tree-kills them
#   * Process table: if possible, daemonz dumps the process table, looks for
#                    the processes that look like the daemon, and tree-kills
#                    them
#   * Pattern matching: processes whose command lines have the same arguments
#                       as those given to daemon "look like" that daemon
#   * Tree killing: a daemon is killed by killing its main process, together
#                   with all processes descending from that process; a process
#                   is first sent SIGTERM and, if it's still alive after a
#                   couple of seconds, it's sent a SIGKILL
